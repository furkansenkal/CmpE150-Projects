					Question 1: <br><br>
					<code>Calculate Compound Interest (100 points)</code>

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						Your task is from the compound interest for a given amount of money, interest rate and duration calculating the total amount.<br>
						<b>Assume that input will be provided by the user; with the amount (in money) first, interest rate (monthly) second and duration (in months) last.</b><br>
						We provided a line of code for you which will handle the printing. Note that it uses a variable <code>total_amount</code> which we expect you to put your result in, so that it can be printed.<br>
						You must handle the input taking part as well, and <b>DO NOT WRITE ANY PROMPTS</b> for the user while taking the input.<br>
						The formula for calculating compound interest is given below.

						Check the examples for further clarification.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Warning:</b> You are not allowed to use imports and topics that haven't been covered yet.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Hint:</b> The money someone puts to interest is most likely going to be a whole number. Interest rate is most likely going to be a decimal number, and duration in months will most likely be a whole number as well.<br>
						We won't tell you these all the time, but for now you can make these assumptions.
