					Question 1: <br><br>
					<code>Calculate Power Recursively (100 points)</code>
				</h1>
				<div>
					Please read <a href="ReadMe.html">important information</a> first.
				</div>
				<div id="page1">
					<h2>Description</h2>					
					<p>
						You are given some code and you are expected to complete the function that takes two parameters: <b>b</b> (base) and <b>e</b> (exponent) and returns the result of calculated power: b^e.<br>
						The task is to complete this function so that power is calculated <b>recursively</b>.<br>
						The input taking part is handled for you. You can assume the following:
						<ul>
							<li>b can be any number.</li>
							<li>e can be any integer number.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Check the examples for further clarification. Keep in mind that we will be grading your code not just based on these examples, but other cases as well,	so try to write code which can handle all possible cases.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Warning 1:</b> You are not allowed to use imports and topics that haven't been covered this semester.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Warning 2:</b> Non-recursive implementations will be detected by manual inspection and get no points. For the purposes of this question, solving it iteratively and then calling another function recursively does <b>not</b> count as a recursive implementation.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Hint:</b> Calculating positive and negative powers can be done very similarly.
					</p>
