					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						You are expected to write the code which takes two input numbers from the user and prints each prime number between these numbers, <b>including the input numbers.</b><br>
						<b>Assume that the user only inputs non-negative integers, and the smaller number will be given first.</b> You must print the number, followed by " is a prime number!" (without the quotation marks) if it is a prime.<br>
						<b>Do not use any input prompts.</b> If there are no prime numbers between the given numbers, print "No prime numbers found." (without the quotation marks).
					</p>
					<p>
						Check the examples for further clarification. Keep in mind that we will be grading your code not just based on these examples, but other cases as well,	so try to write code which can handle all possible cases.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Definition:</b> Prime numbers are integers greater than one with no positive divisors besides one and itself. Negative numbers are excluded.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Warning:</b> You are not allowed to use imports and topics that haven't been covered this semester.
					</p>

					<b>Examples:</b>
					<table>
