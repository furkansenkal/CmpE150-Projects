						In this quiz you will read a word (string) from the user. You will search this word in 'dataset.txt' file which is provided inside src folder which is the same folder as your Main.py file. In 'dataset.txt' file there will be several lines and in each line there will be numbers and words separated by spaces. All numbers will be positive integers and all words will only consist of lowercase letters. We want you to find lines that contain the input word and print the summation of the numbers found in those lines. If the input word is not in 'dataset.txt', then print 0.

						A word can be found on more than one line.  A word can be found more than one time on the same line.
