					Question 2: <br><br>
					<code>Print Geometric Series Sum (100 points)</code>

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						Your task is to code a function which calculates the sum of a geometric series of <code>n</code> numbers denoted with coefficient <code>a</code> and ratio <code>r</code>. The numbers will be provided by the user in the order: a first, then r and lastly n.<br>
						Printing is handled by us, so all you need to do is to implement the function and have it return an accurate, suitable result.<br>
						<b>Assume that all input numbers will be provided by the user; n will always be a non-negative integer, a and r can be any number but r cannot be exactly 1. The geometric series sum formula is provided in the image below.</b><br>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Definition:</b> A geometric series is the sum of an infinite number of terms that have a constant ratio between successive terms. However; their sum can be expressed for a finite interval of n numbers without loss of generality, using the same closed form formula.

						Check the examples for further clarification. Keep in mind that we will be grading your code not just based on these examples, but other cases as well, <br>
						so try to write code which can handle all possible cases.
